[![Build](https://github.com/c1m50c/rust-algorithms/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/c1m50c/rust-algorithms/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Library containing various algorithms implemented with a Rust counter-part.


## **Running**
You can test the algorithms to ensure they work by using `cargo test`, an example of it's usage is shown below.
```bash
$ cd rust-algorithms # Change directory to repository.
$ cargo test # Run the `cargo test` command to run the library's tests.
...
test result: ok. # If things go well all tests should pass.
```
